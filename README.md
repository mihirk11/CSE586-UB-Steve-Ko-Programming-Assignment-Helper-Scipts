# CSE586-UB-Steve-Ko-Programming-Assignment-Helper-Scipts
Some Shell scripts I created to run Dr. Ko's CSE586 PA grader multiple times and halt when error occurs. 

The PA4 grader takes 30 min to complete single run and stops when error occurs. Instead of running every 30 min, if run in a loop, the error in an intermediate run can get lost in the console. This scrips stops when error occurs else continues to execute multiple times.
