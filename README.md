# CSE586-UB-Steve-Ko-Programming-Assignment-Helper-Scipts
Some Shell scripts I created to run Dr. Ko's CSE586 PA grader multiple times and halt when error occurs. 

The PA4 grader takes 30 min to complete single run and stops when error occurs. Instead of running every 30 min, if run in a loop, the error in an intermediate run can get lost in the console. These scrips stop when error occurs else continue to execute multiple times. Also store output of each run in saparate files for later examination. 

May help future students of the class.
